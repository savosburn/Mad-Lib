/*
Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

Example Output
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly
Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
Constraints
Use a single output statement for this program.
If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, use it to build up the output.
